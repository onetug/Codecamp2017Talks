## .Net code camp 2017 demo - Micro-services with Docker and .Net Core

Thanks to everyone who attended my session and anyone interested in finding my demos here.
The demos (which are fully functional in this repo) are divided into 2 segments:

* Step 1: Create SQL server docker image from Microsoft base image
* Step 2: Create .Net core console app and Dockerize it

To access each segement, go to the readme of the folder for each step (1-sql-docker-image and 2-console-app). Follow the steps or simply run the examples from the code. Note that these were all written based on Windows docker hosts so the file paths are in Windows format and will need to change if you are running on Linux/Mac OS.
